   INSTRUCTIONS:
   Place this file in a folder named programming/3/.
   This file contains the following completed method. Use it as a model
   to help you with the other methods:
   - buildBoard
   This file also contains stubs (empty methods) for the following
   methods (split into 3 levels):
   Basic level (complete all):
   - printBoard *
   - copyBoard *
   Intermediate level (complete Basic methods plus this method):
   - explodeSquare *
   Advanced level (complete Basic + Intermediate + these two methods):
   - explodeAllChar *
   - downString
   The routines with the * will be particularly helpful for the
   Conway's Game of Life project that you'll work on after this one.

     Parameters:
     board - a 2D array of char

     Returns:
     nothing
     A location in a 2D array can be thought of as having 8
     neighbors.  In the below 2D array, the neighbors of the element
     marked Q are the numbered elements.
     oooooo
     o123oo
     o4Q5oo
     o678oo
     oooooo
     This method should change all the neighbor cells (elements) to an X
     but not change the element at row,col
     Ex:
     Given the 2D array
     QQQQQ
     QQQQQ
     QQQQQ
     QQQQQ
     explodeSquare(board,1,1) will change the array to
     XXXQQ
     XQXQQ
     XXXQQ
     QQQQQ
     Note: Make sure to correctly handle the cases when you try
     to explode an element on the edges.
