//Prework Assignment 7
//ThinkJava Chapter 8
//Exercise 2
//Exercise description: The purpose of this exercise is to practice reading code and recognizing the traversal patterns in this chapter. The following methods are hard to read, because instead of using meaningful names for the variables and methods, they use names of fruit.
For each method, write one sentence that describes what the method does, without getting into the details of how it works. For each variable, identify the role it plays.



public static int banana(int[] a) {
    int kiwi = 1;
    int i = 0;
    while (i < a.length) {
        kiwi = kiwi * a[i];
        i++;
    }
    return kiwi;
}

Method: The method bannana takes an array of integers variable "a" and returns the product of all it's elements.
Varibles:
  a=array
  i=index
  a=array


public static int grapefruit(int[] a, int grape) {
    for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        if (a[i] == grape) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
Method: The method grapefruit searches or traverses through the array for the element "grape". The method does not find the target and therefore returns -1 to indicate a failed search. 
Varibles: 
  Grape= target
  i= index
  a= array

public static int pineapple(int[] a, int apple) {
    int pear = 0;
    for (int pine: a) {
        if (pine == apple) {
            pear++;
        }
    }
    return pear;
}
Method: The method pineapple traverses through the array "a" for the element "apple" and counts the total number of times that "apple" is present in the "a" array.
Variables: 
  a= array
  apple= target
  pear= index
  pine= a[i]
