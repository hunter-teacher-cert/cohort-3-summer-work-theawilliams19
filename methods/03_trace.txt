CODE TRACING in the classroom
======================================


PROS:
---------------------------------------
<general positive aspects of incorporating code or algorithm tracing into a CS course, from your perspective>

- Making the conceptual/abstract more concrete. 
- Helps you learn how the computer reads and processes   
  the code.
- Functions as pseudocode. Helps figure out how to write 
  actual code.

CONS:
---------------------------------------
<general negative aspects of incorporating code or algorithm tracing into a CS course, from your perspective>
- Not every tracing style will make sense to every   
  learner.
- Looking at another person's trace will not always   
  provide clarification that your own trace makes.
- If the tracing style does NOT work for the learner it 
  can move them further from understanding rather than 
  closer.
- Time consuming

BEST FOR:
---------------------------------------
<types of activities from courses you teach or have taught that could benefit from an emphasis on tracing>
- Abstract structures (e.g. loops, recursions)
- Order of operations
- How multiple methods interact

LEAST-SUITED TO:
---------------------------------------
<opposite of above -- and why>
- If it is either something too much or too little to trace (break large tasks into smaller chunks)


PROVEN PRO-TIPS:
---------------------------------------
<
 anything that has worked well for any member of your team, in the way of ...
 * live tracing ("trace-along" a la livecoding)
 * tracing as an assignment
 * tools, physical/online/otherwise that make it easier/clearer
 * etc 
>
- Small whiteboards with color-coding using different 
  color dry erase markers
- Archiving traces (e.g. method uploading pics to a padlet)
-
