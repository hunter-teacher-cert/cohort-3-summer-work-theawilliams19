# Scaffolding Techniques

### Technique: Commenting within Skeletons

#### Well-suited to...
* helping students to understand the task/purpose in plain English
* supporting students' computational thinking/understanding the logic
* breaking a larger task/method down into smaller manageable parts

#### Sort
* name of a coding activity (like BinarySearch, For loops, etc)
* name of a not-necessarily coding activity
* code snippet to illustrate
* etc
 #### Example comments from SortSearchReference.java:
*  /*
      return the index of the smallest data idem from index start to the end
      of the ArrayList. If there are multiple of the smallest value,
      return any of them.
      
      Example, if the arraylist has:
      5,3,10,6,8
      if start was 2 (start at index 2, value 10) then it would return 3
      which is the index of the value 6 which is the index with the
      smallest value from start to end
      On the other hand, if start was 0, then the method would
      return 1 since the value 3 is in index 1 and that is the smallest.      
    */


### Technique: Clearly communicating differentiated (product, process or content) learning expectations and levels of competency 

#### Well-suited to...
* Meeting the needs different types of learners
* Helping students better understand deliverables
* Helping students better understand the concepts/skills that they should be taking away from a lesson activity
* Helping to students to self or peer assess
* Clearly communicating to students the standards for success
* Helping students to self-reflect/self-correct
