This scaffolded activity has all of the code blocks in it, so it doesn't have a traditional "solution" per say. 

Students would engage in this scaffolded lesson activity as an introduction to a game design unit and the Scratch interface.

The comments included, would prompt students to change the methods that affect varibles such as a sprite's attributes. For example, such as the sound, score, color, and the position.

Students will be asked to run the program after the value is changed for each variable or method and notice what happens.

Students can use the commenting feature to record their noticings and wonderings.

Students can be challenged to explore adding or changing additional sprites or varialbes such as te backgrounds.
