Sort Project:

Part 1:  (BASIC)
  1. Analyze the two constructors - try to figure out how they work.- DONE
  2. Compile and run the program (SortSearchDriver.java and SortSearch.java) and confirm
  the behavior of the constructors.- DONE
  
Part 2: (BASIC)
  1. Read the description of findSmallestIndex and complete the method.- DONE
  2. Uncomment the lines in SortSearchDriver to test.- DONE
  
Part 3: (INTERMEDIATE)
  1. Complete the sort method - read comments for description - DONE
  2. Uncomment the lines in SortSearchDriver to test. - DONE

Search Project:
  1. Complete the linear search (BASIC)
  2. Complete the binary search (Intermediate)
  3. Complete the recursive version of binary search (Advanced)
